## Introduction

Simple Password Meter is an easy-to-use password meter plugin written in pure JavaScript. It's so simple, I don't think it needs any documentation.

It's heavily based on [this JQuery package](https://github.com/elboletaire/password-strength-meter).

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save simple-password-meter.js
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add simple-password-meter.js
```

In order to use it, and after importing the library:

```javascript
new password.meter(document.getElementById('password'))
```
